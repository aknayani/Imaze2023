It should be operated using your mobile phone.<br>In the game three stages are there : In first stage there will be a race round in which the competitors have to do laps and each car’s lap time will be measured, the path or lap includes obstacles and rough path with checkpoints after this stage top 5 participated teams will be selected.In the second stage the selected top 5 teams have to perform parallel parking and top 2 will be selected and in the very last stage both the selected teams have to do a race in which the winner will be selected.<br>  • Round 1: One has to operate the car in such a way that it completes the lap in the minimum amount of time possible.<br>  • Round 2: The selected top 5 will then perform parallel parking. The selection for the next round will be judged based on the time they took for parallel parking. There will be penalties for touching the boundaries.<br>  • Round 3: The selected top 2 will race, and the winner will be selected.<br>",

They solve as many questions as possible in 1-minute intervals, passing the puzzle to the next member. This rotation continues until all members attempt each puzzle once.<br>  Phase 2: A buzzer-based coding test begins. A problem statement is displayed on a projector, and teams must press the buzzer within 20-30 seconds. <br>• Brain Power Duo: The 6 remaining teams are split into pairs, resulting in 2 members per team. Simultaneously, teams tackle creativity and problem-solving questions alongside coding challenges. The first five teams to solve the questions gain hints for the coding round.<br>In this round, teams receive only a sample input and output and must code accordingly.",

The challenge is to create a stable building capable of withstanding vibrations. The building should have a minimum of 3 stories and a maximum of 5 stories. Scoring depends on construction time and the relevance of steps to the context. The more precise and contextually relevant their structures are, the higher their score.<br>• Round 2 (Apply Vibrations To The Structures): In this round, teams place their structures on a Vibration Testing Machine, aiming to withstand vibrations or earthquake loads. One team member operates the machine while a volunteer supervises and records the load resistance. Effective teamwork, building on skills from the previous round, is crucial. Points are awarded based on the maximum amount of load resisted by the structure within a 10-minute time limit.<br>",
